/**
 * File-based mailbox protocol for the `:modelservice` worker (TF-B: reliable
 * worker lifecycle — replaces the old "stopSelf == reclamation proof" model).
 *
 * The main process and the worker communicate via marker files inside the
 * per-request staging directory; the worker owns ITS OWN lifecycle via
 * [ModelExecutionLifecycle] (state machine) and a `state.json` dump. The main
 * process can only REQUEST a shutdown; it can never kill the worker on its
 * own counters.
 *
 * Files per request dir:
 *   - request.json          client → worker: the serialized request
 *   - cancel                client → worker: cancellation requested
 *   - cancel.ack            worker → client: cancel acknowledged
 *   - result.tmp            worker: atomic-write staging (never seen by client)
 *   - result.json           worker → client: terminal result (atomic rename)
 *   - state.json            worker: lifecycle state dump (ACTIVE / STOPPING / DEAD …)
 *   - client.ack            client → worker: client consumed the result
 *   - worker.pid            worker: verifiable pid/runId/nonce ref (see ModelExecutionRunDir)
 *   - worker.ready          worker: fully started & pid ref written
 *   - terminal.json         worker: LAST marker — stream flushed + result committed
 *                           + final state written, then terminal.json created
 *                           atomically; followed by client.ack + self-reap.
 *
 * TF-F ownership rules:
 *   - terminal.json (NOT result.json / cancel.ack alone) is the definitive
 *     "worker has stopped writing to this run dir" signal. result.json can
 *     exist while the worker is still in finishRequest() (writeState) — that
 *     exact race produced the P0 state.json ENOENT FATAL.
 *   - The client deletes a run dir ONLY after [ModelExecutionRunDir.safeToDelete]
 *     (terminal + confirmed worker-pid gone). UNKNOWN liveness ≠ safe.
 *   - All worker writes are defensive (return Boolean, never throw): a
 *     reclaimed dir must log a protocol violation, never crash the worker.
 *
 * Atomicity: the worker writes result.tmp, flush + fsync, then renames to
 * result.json — the client NEVER observes a partial result. Cancel is
 * acknowledged with cancel.ack BEFORE the client deletes the directory (the
 * old code wrote cancel then immediately deleteRecursively, which raced the
 * worker's appends to stream.jsonl / result.json).
