/**
 * Keeps the downgrade guard's decision policy and its two constants honest.
 *
 * ## What this protects
 *
 * [DatabaseVersionGuard.CODE_DB_VERSION] duplicates the `version` in
 * [AppDatabase]'s `@Database` annotation, because that annotation has BINARY
 * retention and is not readable at runtime. Two copies of one number is
 * exactly what drifts on the next schema bump, and drift is silent in both
 * directions:
 *
 *  - constant too LOW → the guard fires on every launch of a healthy install
 *    and the user is stuck on the "your data is from a newer version" screen
 *    forever;
 *  - constant too HIGH → the guard never fires and a real downgrade goes back
 *    to crashing at first database access.
 *
 * This repo has `exportSchema = false` (no committed schema JSON to compare
 * against), so the cross-check reads the annotation straight out of the
 * source file instead. Same assertion, different source of truth.
 *
 * ## Why the policy is tested through [DatabaseVersionGuard.decide]
 *
 * That is the whole decision table — `decide` and [isHandledDowngrade] are
 * pure, so they can be driven table-driven with hard-coded literals. Every
 * expected value below is a literal, never derived from the constant under
 * test: a mutated constant must turn a row RED rather than quietly re-pass.
 *
 * [DatabaseVersionGuard.evaluate] is deliberately NOT exercised here — it
 * needs a real `Context` and a real `SQLiteDatabase`, which only exist on a
 * device. Its only two outputs are `null` (no file / unreadable file) and an
 * integer; both feed `decide` and are covered by the rows below.
