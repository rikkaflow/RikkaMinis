/**
 * Detects a database written by a NEWER build than the one now running,
 * before Room ever opens it.
 *
 * ## The failure this prevents
 *
 * Room resolves a downgrade by calling `onUpgrade(from, to)` and looking for
 * a migration path. Finding none it consults `isMigrationRequired`, which
 * either throws `IllegalStateException` or — with a destructive fallback
 * enabled — calls `dropAllTables`. We enable no fallback (deliberately:
 * dropping would destroy the user's entire chat history), so an unmatched
 * downgrade means the app throws at first database access and simply will
 * not start.
 *
 * This fork is a sideloaded self-signed build: users roll back to the
 * previous APK to diagnose a problem, and move between stable and branch
 * builds on the same install. That is exactly the on-disk version 13 /
 * code version 12 situation this guard exists for.
 *
 * Note the guard is not optional even if a downgrade migration could be
 * registered: Room 2.6.1 only accepts a downgrade whose `from` version is
 * reachable from `@Database` `version`, so a `Migration(13, 12)` cannot
 * exist in a `version = 12` build at all (`MigrationManager.buildMap`
 * throws "Migrations must be chained"). Each schema bump therefore has to
 * ship its reverse in the SAME commit that lands the bump — and any bump
 * that is not purely additive has no safe reverse whatsoever.
 *
 * ADD COLUMN / ADD TABLE is the one shape with a lossless reverse (Room
 * binds by column name and ignores extra columns), but renames, drops, type
 * changes and — most dangerously — changes to the MEANING of existing data
 * have no safe automatic downgrade. And a missing link anywhere in the chain
 * (13 → 12 → 11) breaks the whole path, which is the plain human case of
 * forgetting to add the downgrade migration at all. This guard is the
 * backstop for all of that.
 *
 * ## Why a pre-check instead of catching Room's exception
 *
 * `Room.databaseBuilder(...).build()` is lazy: nothing opens until the first
 * DAO call, so the exception surfaces from an arbitrary coroutine somewhere
 * deep in the app. Every one of those call sites would need a catch, and one
 * miss is still a crash. Reading the version first is deterministic and
 * happens once, in one place ([MinisApp.onCreate] via [evaluate]).
 *
 * Crucially, this runs BEFORE Room is constructed — so at the moment we
 * decide, no migration and no `dropAllTables` can possibly have executed.
 * The database file is guaranteed untouched, which is what lets the
 * guidance screen promise the user that nothing was lost.
 *
 * ## Why the decision logic is split out from the probe
 *
 * [decide] and [isHandledDowngrade] are pure: no `Context`, no `SQLiteDatabase`,
 * no logging. They are what the JVM unit test (`DatabaseVersionGuardTest`)
 * drives table-driven with hard-coded version numbers, so the policy cannot
 * drift without a test failing. Everything that touches an Android type lives
 * in the two members below them.
