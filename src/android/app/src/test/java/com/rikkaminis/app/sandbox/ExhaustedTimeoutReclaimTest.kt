/**
 * [audit-RC7] JVM tests for the exhausted-timeout reclaim decision.
 *
 * Invariant: a command that timed out (exitCode == 124) on its FINAL retry
 * must still trigger shell reclamation — `withTimeoutOrNull` only cancels
 * the coroutine, the command keeps running inside the PTY, and its late
 * output (with the stale __MINIS_DONE_<marker>__ line) would otherwise be
 * scanned into the next command's output on the same shell.
