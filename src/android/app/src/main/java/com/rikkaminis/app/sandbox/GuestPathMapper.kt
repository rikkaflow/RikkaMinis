/**
 * Guest → host path translation for native_offload handlers that operate on
 * the REAL filesystem instead of going through PRoot's ptrace boundary
 * ([T-minis-fastio]).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * PRoot pays ~100-200µs per path-touching syscall (ptrace stop/resume round
 * trip + POKEDATA rewrite of the translated path). A handler that runs in the
 * app process operates on the same files through ordinary JVM `java.io` /
 * `java.nio` calls, i.e. ~1µs per op — but only if it can turn the guest path
 * the shell passed it into the real host path. That mapping is the whole
 * reason this object exists; everything else in `minis-fastio` is a walk.
 *
 * ## One table, two consumers
 *
 * The authoritative bind table is the one PRoot itself was launched with:
 * `-r <rootfs>` (catch-all) plus every `-b <host>:<guest>` that
 * [PRootKernel.buildProotCommand] emitted for this session. [sessionBindings]
 * rebuilds exactly that list from the same inputs the command line is built
 * from — the live [PRootKernel.bindMounts] map (globals + user mounts) and
 * [PER_SESSION_SUBDIRS] (which [PRootKernel] also uses) — so there is one
 * source of truth, not a second copy that drifts.
 *
 * ## The guard (never traded away)
 *
 * Translation is refuse-instead-of-guess. A guest path is accepted only when
 * its canonical host form is provably contained in the host base of the
 * binding it matched. `..` above `/`, the host pseudo-filesystems, and
 * symlinks pointing out of a binding all come back as [Resolution.Denied]
 * rather than as a best guess. Callers that mutate the filesystem are
 * expected to layer their own policy on top (see [Resolution.Ok.isBindingRoot]
 * and [Binding.isExternalMount]).
