/**
 * One stable markdown fragment slot produced by [AppendOnlyMarkdownSegmenter].

 * Invariants (the whole point of the segmenter):
 *  - A [settled] slot's `rawText` NEVER changes after publication.
 *  - The live (non-settled) slot is always the LAST slot; it may only grow
 *    (append) while the stream is producing content.
 *  - `ordinal` is a monotonic per-message sequence number — it is the stable
 *    part of the row key (`mdslot:<messageId>:<blockId>:<ordinal>`) so
 *    LazyColumn anchors never see keys deleted or reordered mid-stream.

/**
 * Append-only markdown fragment segmenter for a single streaming text block.
 *
 * Replaces the "re-split + coalesce on every tick / at stream end" behaviour
 * of [buildFlatChatItems] for the LIVE tail of an active assistant turn.
 *
 * The contract:
 *  - [update] takes the cumulative markdown snapshot of ONE text block plus a
 *    `streamEnded` flag. It returns the current list of stable slots.
 *  - Published (settled) slots are immutable: once a fragment boundary has
 *    closed them they are never modified, never deleted, never reordered.
 *  - New fragment boundaries only append NEW slots at the tail; the previous
 *    live slot is settled in place with its content frozen.
 *  - A regressive snapshot (shorter + prefix — see
 *    [shouldIgnoreRegressiveStreamingSnapshot]) is ignored entirely.
 *  - Any other non-append divergence (the model rewrote earlier text) cannot
 *    be repaired by key churn: the fresh content is absorbed into the live
 *    slot and [invariantErrorCount] is incremented. Published keys stay put.
 *  - `streamEnded=true` only settles the last slot — it does NOT re-split,
 *    does NOT coalesce, does NOT change keys.
 *
 * The split boundary rules deliberately match [splitMarkdownIntoBlockTexts]:
 * blank lines outside code fences and complete fenced code blocks are
 * closable boundaries; an unterminated fence keeps everything inside the live
 * slot.
