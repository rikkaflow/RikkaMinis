 *
 * Ported from rikkahub's `extractThinkingTitle` (its last line that consists of
 * a single bold span), then adapted to this app's real data. Two shapes are
 * observed in our own sessions (2026-09-28 samples):
 *
 *  • concatenated phrases on one line — `**我统计子包层级****我把子包层级也数清楚**`
 *    (session 4a9ba4d3, 11:32). The verbatim whole-line rule returns the merged
 *    blob `我统计子包层级****我把子包层级也数清楚`; the NEWEST span (`我把子包层级也数清楚`)
 *    is the useful one, so a pure bold run takes its last span.
 *  • a phrase followed by its explanation — `**Clarifying the scope first…** Before …`.
 *    Here the phrase is the line-leading span, so that one wins.
 *
 * Line-leading only: an inline `**emphasis**` mid-sentence is not a title, and a
 * phrase inside a fenced code block is never reported (see the parity note in
 * the body): a tail still left inside an unterminated fence refuses outright —
 * thinking text of a coding agent often ends inside a code fence.
 *
 * Frozen blocks are deliberately excluded by the caller (title shows while
 * streaming only, matching rikkahub, whose title is likewise gated on
 * `loading`): a title on every row of a long transcript rebuilds the per-row
 * title wall that the 2026-09-28 pill-fold experiment was reverted for.
 *
 * Pure + Android-free, so the sandbox JVM harness compiles it directly.
