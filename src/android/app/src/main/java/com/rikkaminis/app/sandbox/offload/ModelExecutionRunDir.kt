/**
 * TF-F: run-directory ownership + worker-liveness protocol utilities.
 *
 * The P0 bug this module fixes: the main process deleted a `run-*` dir while
 * the `:modelservice` worker was still in `finishRequest()` writing
 * `state.json`, causing an uncaught ENOENT FATAL in the worker process (crash
 * buffer: `FileNotFoundException .../state.json open failed ENOENT`), which
 * the client mis-classified as `worker died` and re-tried 3× until exhausted.
 *
 * The ownership rules implemented here:
 *   - A run dir belongs to exactly ONE worker process and exactly ONE request
 *     (identified by runId + nonce). No global "last stream dir" surrogate —
 *     each side passes its own run dir explicitly.
 *   - The main process deletes a run dir ONLY after it has confirmed both a
 *     terminal marker AND that the worker's PID is gone (or the worker never
 *     started and we hold the terminal marker + the pid ref is absent/stale).
 *   - Liveness is THREE-STATE: only an explicit "the pid referenced by THIS
 *     run's worker.pid is gone AND the ref matches our runId" is DEAD.
 *     Anything ambiguous is UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN never authorizes deletion
 *     nor a `worker died` classification.
