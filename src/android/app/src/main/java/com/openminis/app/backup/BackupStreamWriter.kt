/**
 * [T-backup-streaming-export] Streaming writer for the backup document.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: building the payload as one in-memory String does not
 * scale. A 64MB document (budget-trimmed chat history) means a 129MB
 * char[] (UTF-16) for the final String, a ~130MB intermediate
 * StringBuilder during toString, AND the fully materialized JSONObject
 * tree (~250MB for ~150k messages) — 500MB+ of transient allocations on
 * a 512MB largeHeap. Measured on-device 2026-08-31: OOM at the final
 * toString with exactly payload×2 as the failing allocation.
 *
 * The fix keeps the *budget algorithm* unchanged (it decides WHAT to
 * include) and replaces the *assembly* with a streaming write: the
 * document is emitted chunk by chunk into a [Writer] (file output stream
 * / network request body), so the final String and the intermediate
 * StringBuilder never exist. Peak drops to the JSON tree of the kept
 * messages + per-chunk temporaries.
 *
 * Chunk shapes are byte-identical to what JSONObject.toString() emits for
 * the same data (compact form, same key order — see JsonChunkSink notes),
 * so an import cannot tell a streamed document from a legacy one.
