/**
 * [native-rss-tool-guard / D-2] App-level persisted "max concurrent agent-loop
 * sessions" preference. Phase 0 hard-coded the cross-session concurrency cap
 * to 2 at three aligned places (SessionConcurrencyManager, ExecutionCoordinator,
 * NativeOffloadServer) to keep the shared main-process native/mmap RSS from
 * climbing to the 5.8–6.0GB SIGABRT seen on 2026-08-19. D-2 makes that cap
 * configurable + observable so the user can run with 2 for a while, read the
 * slot occupancy, then evaluate widening to 3.
 *
 * Mirrors the FastModePrefs pattern: [prime] warms a volatile cache from
 * persisted state once at app startup (MinisApp.onCreate); the context-free [maxConcurrentSessions] is then safe to call from any layer
 * (sandbox singletons etc.) that has no Context. The value is read once at
 * prime time and held until the next process start, so a change applies the
 * next time the app process launches — safe, no runtime slot resizing.
 *
 * Deliberately a SINGLE cap shared by all three coordinated gates. Phase 0
 * aligned them to the same bound on purpose; a single knob keeps them aligned
 * (changing one without the other two would silently let one path burst past
 * the budget the rest of the memory machinery was sized for).
