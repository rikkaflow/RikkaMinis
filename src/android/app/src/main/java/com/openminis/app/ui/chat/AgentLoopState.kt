/**
 * FE-5 route C step 2: the mutable run-scoped state of
 * ChatViewModel.runAgentLoop, lifted out of ~40 scattered `var`s into one
 * data holder. The VM constructs it at loop entry; the engine (and later
 * steps) mutate fields on it directly — same single-threaded (loop
 * coroutine) discipline as when they were locals, so no new sync.
 *
 * Field-by-field this is a verbatim lift of the local `var`/`val` block at
 * runAgentLoop entry (see git history for the exact original comments);
 * only the trace observer fields stayed on the observer itself.
 *
 * NOTE on threading: [AssistantBlock]/tool-input maps are mutated only
 * from the loop coroutine (plus Main-hopped UI snapshot flips driven by
 * that same coroutine), exactly as before. Do NOT touch these from other
 * coroutines.
