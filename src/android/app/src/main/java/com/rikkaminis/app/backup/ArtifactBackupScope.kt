/**
 * [T-auto-backup-assets] Selection policy for the artifact backup section —
 * the user's *task outputs* (`/var/minis/shared`, plus MCP memory-server data
 * like knowledge-graph JSONL), NOT the chat transcript.
 *
 * The user's model of this app: it is an agent app, not a chat app. Chat
 * history is 90% process byproduct and deliberately excluded from the
 * automatic backup (manual full exports keep their own chat window setting).
 * What MUST be protected is what the agent *produced*: handoff docs, audit
 * reports, tools, evaluations, knowledge graphs.
 *
 * Pure JVM so the include/exclude rules are unit-testable without Android.
