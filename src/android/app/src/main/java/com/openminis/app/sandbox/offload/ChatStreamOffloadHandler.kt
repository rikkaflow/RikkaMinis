/**
 * Direction A: offload chat streaming to the [ModelExecutionService] process.
 *
 * Writes a streaming request.json, starts [ModelExecutionService], then incrementally
 * polls the service's stream.jsonl (append-only JSON Lines) and re-emits each decoded
 * [LLMStreamChunk] downstream as it arrives.
 *
 * Hardening notes (Tier 1):
 *  - failure propagation: an `error` line in the stream throws so the caller falls
 *    back to in-process (never a fabricated Finished).
 *  - cancellation propagation: cancelling the flow writes the cancel marker file so the
 *    service aborts its stream collection promptly.
 *  - incremental reads: we keep a byte offset and re-open/seek, never re-read whole file.
